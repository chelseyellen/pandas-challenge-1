# pandas-challenge-1
## Introduction
This class challenge was to utilize pandas across various data research, formatting, and manipulation exercises. This was accomplished through exercises that required the class to:
* Create a repository in GitHub
* Explore the data to describe the various columns, data types, range index, and other basic data to help eplore and understand the data set in depth.
* Transform the data using formulas, adding columns, and including the new data we had calculated into the tables
* Use functions to confirm that our work was valid
* Summarize & analyze the data through calling data to answer questions, creating new dataframes with unique values, and reformatting the headers to reflect a more accurate description of the data

## Results
This exercise was excellent and allowed me to utilize a diverse set of skills to practice pandas. I feel very confident that I can build upon this foundation in future weeks.
